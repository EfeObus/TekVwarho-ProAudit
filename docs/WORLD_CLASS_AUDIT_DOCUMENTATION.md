## 1. Hashed Chain Immutable Ledger

### Overview

The immutable ledger implements a blockchain-like hash chain where every financial transaction creates a ledger entry that is cryptographically linked to the previous entry.

### Technical Implementation

**Model:** `app/models/advanced_accounting.py` - `LedgerEntry`

```python
class LedgerEntry(BaseModel):
    __tablename__ = "ledger_entries"
    
    entity_id = Column(UUID)
    sequence_number = Column(Integer)
    entry_type = Column(String(50))      # transaction, adjustment, opening_balance
    source_type = Column(String(50))     # invoice, payment, journal
    source_id = Column(UUID)
    
    account_code = Column(String(50))
    debit_amount = Column(Numeric(18, 2))
    credit_amount = Column(Numeric(18, 2))
    balance = Column(Numeric(18, 2))
    
    # Hash Chain Fields
    previous_hash = Column(String(256))  # Hash of previous entry
    entry_hash = Column(String(256))     # SHA-256 hash of this entry
```

**Service:** `app/services/immutable_ledger.py`

**Hash Calculation:**
```python
entry_data = {
    "sequence_number": sequence_number,
    "entity_id": str(entity_id),
    "entry_type": entry_type,
    "source_type": source_type,
    "source_id": str(source_id),
    "account_code": account_code,
    "debit_amount": str(debit_amount),
    "credit_amount": str(credit_amount),
    "balance": str(balance),
    "currency": currency,
    "entry_date": entry_date.isoformat(),
    "description": description,
    "reference": reference,
    "created_by_id": str(created_by_id),
    "previous_hash": previous_hash,
    "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
}

entry_hash = hashlib.sha256(
    json.dumps(entry_data, sort_keys=True).encode('utf-8')
).hexdigest()
```

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/v1/entities/{id}/forensic-audit/verify-integrity` | POST | Verify hash chain integrity |
| `/api/v1/entities/{id}/forensic-audit/ledger-integrity-report` | GET | Detailed integrity report |

### User Feature: "Verify Integrity" Button

**Behavior:**
- Recalculates all hashes in the chain
- If all match: ✅ Green "Data Integrity Verified" badge
- If mismatch: ❌ Red "Integrity Breach Detected" warning

**Response Example (Valid):**
```json
{
    "verified": true,
    "status": "DATA_INTEGRITY_VERIFIED",
    "badge": "green",
    "message": "✅ All ledger entries verified. Hash chain is intact.",
    "discrepancy_count": 0,
    "verified_at": "2026-01-07T12:00:00Z"
}
```

**Response Example (Tampered):**
```json
{
    "verified": false,
    "status": "INTEGRITY_BREACH_DETECTED",
    "badge": "red",
    "message": "⚠️ Data integrity issues detected. Immediate investigation required.",
    "discrepancy_count": 3,
    "discrepancies": [
        {
            "sequence_number": 1547,
            "type": "broken_chain",
            "message": "Previous hash mismatch at entry #1547"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Audit Purpose

- **Non-Repudiation:** If a malicious actor modifies ANY historical record, all subsequent hashes break
- **Tamper Detection:** Immediate visibility into unauthorized changes
- **Legal Weight:** Provides cryptographic proof of data integrity for tax disputes

## 2. Autonomous 3-Way Matching

### Overview

The 3-Way Matching Engine links three distinct entities for accounts payable audit:

1. **Purchase Order (PO):** What was authorized
2. **Goods Received Note (GRN):** What physically entered the warehouse
3. **NRS-Validated Invoice:** What the vendor is charging

### Technical Implementation

**Service:** `app/services/three_way_matching.py`

**Models:**
- `PurchaseOrder` / `PurchaseOrderItem`
- `GoodsReceivedNote` / `GoodsReceivedNoteItem`
- `ThreeWayMatch`

**Matching Tolerances:**
```python
class MatchingTolerance:
    QUANTITY_TOLERANCE_PCT = Decimal("2")   # 2% quantity variance allowed
    PRICE_TOLERANCE_PCT = Decimal("1")      # 1% price variance allowed
    AMOUNT_TOLERANCE_NGN = Decimal("100")   # NGN 100 absolute tolerance
```

### Matching Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `MATCHED` | All three documents agree on quantity and price |
| `DISCREPANCY` | Mismatch detected - requires investigation |
| `PENDING_REVIEW` | Awaiting manual review |
| `REJECTED` | Match rejected after review |

### API Endpoints

| `/api/v1/entities/{id}/forensic-audit/three-way-matching/exceptions` | GET | High-risk exceptions |

### Auditor's View: Match Summary Report

**Response Example:**
```json
{
    "entity_id": "uuid",
    "period": {
        "start_date": "2026-01-01",
        "end_date": "2026-12-31"

    }
}
```

## 3. NRS Sync Forensic Module

### Overview

In 2026, Nigeria's "Merchant Buyer" framework requires every B2B transaction to have a digital twin on the government's NRS portal. This module compares local ledger entries against NRS-validated invoices.

### Gap Analysis Report

**Service:** `app/services/forensic_audit_service.py` - `NRSGapAnalyzer`

**Checks Performed:**
1. **Missing IRN:** Invoices without Invoice Reference Numbers
2. **Pending Validation:** IRN generated but not validated
3. **B2C High-Value:** B2C transactions > ₦50,000 (2026 reporting required)

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/v1/entities/{id}/forensic-audit/nrs-gap-analysis` | GET | Gap analysis with date range |

## 5. AI-Driven Exception Detection

### Overview

Full Population Testing using statistical and mathematical analysis instead of manual sampling.

### 5.1 Benford's Law Analysis

**Purpose:** Detect fraud in transaction digit distributions

**Methodology:** Benford's Law states that in naturally occurring numerical data, the leading digit follows a specific logarithmic distribution:

| Digit | Expected % |
|-------|------------|
| 1 | 30.1% |
| 2 | 17.6% |
| 3 | 12.5% |
| 4 | 9.7% |
| 5 | 7.9% |
| 6 | 6.7% |
| 7 | 5.8% |
| 8 | 5.1% |
| 9 | 4.6% |

**Conformity Levels (Mean Absolute Deviation):**

| MAD | Level | Risk |
|-----|-------|------|
| < 0.006 | Close Conformity | Low |
| 0.006 - 0.012 | Acceptable | Low |
| 0.012 - 0.015 | Marginal | Medium |
| >= 0.015 | Non-Conforming | High |

### API Endpoint

```
GET /api/v1/entities/{id}/forensic-audit/benfords-law?fiscal_year=2026&analysis_type=first_digit
```

    },
    "anomalies": [],
    "interpretation": "Data shows acceptable conformity to Benford's Law. Distribution is within normal ranges for financial records."
}
```

### 5.2 Z-Score Anomaly Detection

**Purpose:** Identify transactions that deviate significantly from normal patterns

**Methodology:** Z-score measures how many standard deviations a value is from the mean.

**Severity Thresholds:**

| Z-Score | Severity | Probability in Normal Data |
|---------|----------|---------------------------|
| >= 2.0 | Warning | ~2.3% |
| >= 3.0 | Critical | ~0.1% |
| >= 4.0 | Extreme | Virtually never |
