## Accounting Treatment

### Realized FX Gains/Losses
When a foreign currency transaction is settled, any difference between the original recorded amount (at transaction date rate) and the settlement amount (at payment date rate) is recorded as:

- **FX Gain Account (7100):** Credit for gains
- **FX Loss Account (7200):** Debit for losses

### Unrealized FX Gains/Losses
At period-end, monetary items (receivables, payables, foreign currency cash) are revalued using the closing rate:

- **Unrealized FX Gain Account (7110):** Credit for gains
- **Unrealized FX Loss Account (7210):** Debit for losses

These unrealized amounts may be reversed at the start of the next period (optional).

---

## GL Account Structure

| Account Code | Account Name | Type |
|--------------|--------------|------|
| 7100 | Realized FX Gain | Income |
| 7110 | Unrealized FX Gain | Income |
| 7200 | Realized FX Loss | Expense |
| 7210 | Unrealized FX Loss | Expense |

## IAS 21 Compliance

The FX module implements the following IAS 21 requirements:

### Initial Recognition (IAS 21.21)
Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded in the functional currency using the **spot exchange rate** at the date of the transaction.

### Subsequent Measurement (IAS 21.23)
At each reporting date:
- **Monetary items** (cash, receivables, payables) are translated using the **closing rate**
- **Non-monetary items** at historical cost remain at the **historical rate**
- **Non-monetary items** at fair value use the rate at the fair value measurement date

### Recognition of Exchange Differences (IAS 21.28)
Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation are recognized in **profit or loss**, except for:
- Net investment in a foreign operation (recognized in OCI)
- Cash flow hedges (recognized in OCI)

---

## Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `FX001` | Invalid currency code |
| `FX002` | Exchange rate not found for date |
| `FX003` | Rate must be positive |
| `FX004` | Same currency conversion not allowed |
| `FX005` | Future date rate not available |

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Record a USD Invoice

1. **Create invoice** for 1,000 USD when rate is 1,500 NGN/USD:
   - Invoice recorded at 1,500,000 NGN
   
2. **Journal Entry:**
   ```
   Dr. Accounts Receivable (1200)    1,500,000 NGN
       Cr. Sales Revenue (4000)               1,500,000 NGN
   ```

### Example 2: Receive Payment with Rate Change

1. **Receive payment** of 1,000 USD when rate is 1,520 NGN/USD:
   - Cash received: 1,520,000 NGN
   - Original AR: 1,500,000 NGN
   - FX Gain: 20,000 NGN

2. **Journal Entry:**
   ```
   Dr. Cash (1010)                   1,520,000 NGN
       Cr. Accounts Receivable (1200)        1,500,000 NGN
       Cr. FX Gain (7100)                       20,000 NGN
   ```

### Example 3: Period-End Revaluation

1. **Open AR balance** of 5,000 USD at book rate 1,500 = 7,500,000 NGN
2. **Closing rate** is 1,480 NGN/USD
3. **Revalued amount:** 5,000 × 1,480 = 7,400,000 NGN
4. **Unrealized loss:** 100,000 NGN

5. **Journal Entry:**
   ```
   Dr. Unrealized FX Loss (7210)       100,000 NGN
       Cr. Accounts Receivable (1200)         100,000 NGN
   ```

## Rate Type Usage

| Rate Type | When Used |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Spot Rate** | Transaction date recording |
| **Closing Rate** | Period-end revaluation of monetary items |
| **Average Rate** | Income/expense translation in consolidation |
| **Historical Rate** | Non-monetary items, equity items in consolidation |

---

## Best Practices

1. **Daily Rate Updates:** Import exchange rates daily from a reliable source
2. **Rate Source Documentation:** Record the source of each rate for audit trail
3. **Consistent Methodology:** Apply the same rate determination methodology consistently
4. **Timely Revaluation:** Perform FX revaluation at each month-end close
5. **Segregate FX Impacts:** Use separate GL accounts for realized vs unrealized FX effects
