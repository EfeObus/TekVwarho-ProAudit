## 5. Salary Calculations

### 5.1 Gross Salary

```
Monthly Gross = Basic Salary + Housing Allowance + Transport Allowance + Other Allowances
Annual Gross = Monthly Gross × 12
```

### 5.2 Pensionable Earnings

Per PenCom regulations:
```
Pensionable Earnings = Basic + Housing + Transport
```

### 5.3 PAYE Calculation

```
1. Calculate Annual Gross Income
2. Calculate Reliefs:
   - CRA = max(₦200,000, 1% of Gross) + 20% of Gross
   - Pension Relief (8% of pensionable × 12)
   - NHF Relief (2.5% of basic × 12)
   - Other reliefs (rent, life insurance)

3. Taxable Income = Annual Gross - Total Reliefs

4. Apply Tax Bands (cumulative)

5. Monthly PAYE = Annual PAYE ÷ 12
```

### 5.4 Example Calculation

**Employee Salary**:
- Basic: ₦500,000/month
- Housing: ₦250,000/month
- Transport: ₦100,000/month

```
Annual Gross = ₦850,000 × 12 = ₦10,200,000

CRA = max(₦200,000, ₦102,000) + ₦2,040,000 = ₦2,240,000
Pension Relief = ₦850,000 × 8% × 12 = ₦816,000
NHF Relief = ₦500,000 × 2.5% × 12 = ₦150,000
Total Reliefs = ₦3,206,000

Taxable Income = ₦10,200,000 - ₦3,206,000 = ₦6,994,000

Tax Calculation:
- ₦300,000 × 7% = ₦21,000
- ₦300,000 × 11% = ₦33,000
- ₦500,000 × 15% = ₦75,000
- ₦500,000 × 19% = ₦95,000
- ₦1,600,000 × 21% = ₦336,000
- ₦3,794,000 × 24% = ₦910,560

Annual PAYE = ₦1,470,560
Monthly PAYE = ₦122,547
```

---

## Integration Points

1. **Accounting Module**: Journal entries for payroll expenses
2. **Tax Module**: PAYE calculations and returns
3. **Audit System**: Payroll audit trail and evidence
