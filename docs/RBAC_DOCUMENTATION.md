## 5. Organization Verification Flow

```
1. Organization Created → Status: PENDING
       ↓
2. User Uploads CAC/TIN Documents → Status: SUBMITTED
       ↓
3. Admin Reviews Documents → Status: UNDER_REVIEW
       ↓
4a. Approved → Status: VERIFIED (Full platform access)
4b. Rejected → Status: REJECTED (Needs resubmission)
```

---

## 6. Onboarding Hierarchy

### Platform Staff Onboarding

```
Super Admin
    ├── Can onboard: Admin, IT/Developer, CSR, Marketing
    │
Admin
    ├── Can onboard: IT/Developer, CSR, Marketing
    │
IT/Developer, CSR, Marketing
    └── Cannot onboard anyone
```

### Organization User Onboarding

```
Owner
    ├── Can invite: All roles (Admin, Accountant, Auditor, etc.)
    │
Admin
    ├── Can invite: Accountant, Auditor, Payroll Manager, Inventory Manager, Viewer
    │
Other roles
    └── Cannot invite anyone
```

---

## 7. Security Features

### Staff First Login Password Reset

When platform staff are onboarded by Super Admin or Admin:
- The `must_reset_password` flag is set to `True`
- On first login, staff are automatically redirected to the Settings page
- A security banner prompts them to change their password
- Staff cannot access other features until password is changed
- After successful password change, `must_reset_password` is cleared

This ensures that:
1. Temporary onboarding passwords are never used beyond first login
2. Each staff member sets their own secure password
3. Onboarding admins never know the final password

### CSR Impersonation

- Users can grant/revoke impersonation permission
- CSR can only impersonate users who have explicitly allowed it
- Platform staff cannot be impersonated
- All impersonation actions are logged in audit trail

### Email Verification

- New organization users must verify their email before full access
- Verification tokens expire after 24 hours
- Users can request new verification emails via `/api/v1/auth/resend-verification`
- Platform staff are pre-verified during onboarding

### Rate Limiting (Recommended)

Consider adding rate limiting for:
- Login attempts
- Staff onboarding
- User invitations
- Password reset requests

## 9. Environment Variables

```env
# Super Admin Configuration (DO NOT commit actual values)
SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL=<configured-in-env>
SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<configured-in-env>
SUPER_ADMIN_FIRST_NAME=<configured-in-env>
SUPER_ADMIN_LAST_NAME=<configured-in-env>
```

>  **Security Note:** Super Admin credentials are stored securely in `.env` (not committed to version control) and seeded to the database on first startup. Never expose actual credentials in documentation or code.

---

## 10. Quick Start

### Login as Super Admin

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5120/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "$SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL",
    "password": "$SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD"
  }'
```

>  Replace `$SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `$SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` with the values from your `.env` file.

### Onboard an Admin

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5120/api/v1/staff/onboard \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <super_admin_token>" \
  -d '{
    "email": "newadmin@example.com",
    "password": "<secure-password>",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Admin",
    "platform_role": "admin"
  }'
```

>  Use a strong password meeting the platform's password policy. The new staff member will be required to change this password on first login.

### Check Current User Permissions

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5120/api/v1/auth/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## 13. NTAA 2025 Compliance Features

TekVwarho ProAudit implements critical Nigeria Tax Administration Act (NTAA) 2025 compliance features.

### 72-Hour Legal Lock (Invoice State Lock)

Under the NTAA 2025, the government has introduced "Continuous Transaction Controls" (CTC). Buyers have 72 hours to accept or reject an e-invoice on the NRS portal.

**Implementation:**
- Once an invoice is submitted to NRS, it is **locked** (`is_nrs_locked = true`)
- Locked invoices cannot be edited or deleted
- Only the **Owner** can cancel an NRS submission during the 72-hour window
- After the window expires, modifications require a formal **Credit Note**

**New Fields:**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `is_nrs_locked` | Boolean flag - true when submitted to NRS |
| `nrs_lock_expires_at` | 72-hour window expiry timestamp |
| `nrs_cryptographic_stamp` | NRS cryptographic signature for audit |
| `nrs_cancelled_by_id` | Owner who cancelled (if any) |
| `nrs_cancellation_reason` | Reason for cancellation |

**Permission Required:**
- `CANCEL_NRS_SUBMISSION` - Owner only

>  **Legal Warning**: Modifying a "Submitted" invoice without a formal NRS-tracked Credit Note is a criminal offense under the NTAA 2025.

### Maker-Checker Segregation of Duties (SoD)

The 2026 law strictly penalizes mixing personal and business funds. For WREN (Wholly, Reasonably, Exclusively, Necessarily) expense verification:

**Rules:**
- **Maker** (Staff): Creates/uploads an expense
- **Checker** (Accountant): Verifies WREN status
- The Checker **cannot** verify an expense they created (SoD enforcement)

**New Fields in Transactions:**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `created_by_id` | Maker - who created the transaction |
| `wren_verified_by_id` | Checker - who verified WREN status |
| `wren_verified_at` | When verification was performed |
| `original_category_id` | Original category for audit trail |
| `category_change_history` | Before/after snapshots of category changes |

**Permission Required:**
- `VERIFY_WREN` - Available to Owner, Admin, Accountant, External Accountant

### Time-Limited CSR Impersonation (NDPA Compliance)

Per the Nigeria Data Protection Act (NDPA), impersonation access must be time-limited:

**Rules:**
- Maximum **24-hour** window for CSR impersonation
- Users explicitly **grant** access (not a permanent toggle)
- Automatic expiration after the granted period
- All impersonation actions are logged in audit trail

**New Fields in Users:**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `impersonation_granted_at` | When access was granted |
| `impersonation_expires_at` | When access expires (max 24 hours) |

### Enhanced Audit Trail (NTAA 2025 Compliant)

The audit log now captures mandatory fields for tax return submission verification:

**Required Fields:**
| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `ip_address` | Prove source of tax return submission |
| `device_fingerprint` | Browser/device identification |
| `user_agent` | Browser information |
| `session_id` | Track related actions |
| `geo_location` | Approximate location (fraud detection) |
| `impersonated_by_id` | If CSR is acting on behalf of user |

**Before/After Snapshots:**
- Category changes (e.g., Personal → Business) store original values
- Required for protecting Owner during government audits

**NRS Response Storage:**
- `nrs_irn` - Invoice Reference Number
- `nrs_response` - Full server response including cryptographic stamp

---

## 14. Migration

Run the migration to add RBAC and NTAA 2025 fields:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

This will create:
- New enum types (PlatformRole, OrganizationType, VerificationStatus, UserRole with EXTERNAL_ACCOUNTANT)
- Add new columns to users, organizations, invoices, transactions, and audit_logs tables
- Create necessary indexes
