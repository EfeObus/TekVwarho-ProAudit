## Style Guidelines

### Python

```python
# Follow PEP 8 and use type hints
# Use Black for formatting, flake8 for linting

# Good
def calculate_paye(annual_salary: Decimal) -> PAYEResult:
    """Calculate PAYE based on 2026 Nigerian tax bands."""
    # Clear, descriptive names
    pass

# Avoid
def calc(x):
    # Vague names, no type hints
    pass
```

### Naming Conventions

| Type | Convention | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Variables | snake_case | `vat_amount` |
| Functions | snake_case | `calculate_vat()` |
| Classes | PascalCase | `InvoiceService` |
| Constants | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | `VAT_RATE` |
| Files | snake_case | `vat_calculator.py` |
| Django Apps | lowercase | `invoicing`, `tax` |

### Code Documentation

```python
def calculate_paye(annual_salary: Decimal) -> PAYEResult:
    \"\"\"
    Calculate PAYE tax based on 2026 Nigerian tax bands.
    
    Args:
        annual_salary: Gross annual salary in Naira
        
    Returns:
        PAYEResult with monthly and annual tax amounts
        
    Example:
        >>> result = calculate_paye(Decimal('3600000'))
        >>> print(result.monthly_tax)
        Decimal('40000')
    \"\"\"
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Testing Guidelines

```python
# Use pytest with descriptive test names
class TestPAYECalculator:
    def test_returns_zero_tax_for_salary_below_threshold(self):
        \"\"\"Salary below N800,000 should have zero tax.\"\"\"
        result = calculate_paye(Decimal('700000'))
        assert result.annual_tax == Decimal('0')

    def test_applies_fifteen_percent_for_second_bracket(self):
        \"\"\"Salary N800,001 to N2,400,000 should use 15% rate.\"\"\"
        # Test implementation
        pass
```
